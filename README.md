What is Blackjack?
Blackjack is a gambling game that requires only a deck of cards. The goal of the game is to get as close as possible to a hand worth 21 points as the dealer flips over your cards â€“ but go over and you're out!

In Blackjack, numbered cards (2 through 10) are worth their face value, picture cards (jack, queen, and king) are worth 10, and an ace is worth either 1 or 11 depending on your other cards. To start a hand, players place their bets and are dealt two cards face up. They can choose to "hit" (receive another card) or "stick" (stay with their current hand) as they attempt to get as close as possible to 21. If they chose to hit and go over 21, they "bust" and lose the hand (and the money they bet!).

Players face off against the dealer, who starts with one card face down and one face up. When all players have chosen to stick or have busted, the dealer then flips over their hidden card and either hits or sticks, their goal being to get a higher hand than any of the players.

If the dealer busts, they pay out the value of each player's wager to that player, provided that the player hasn't already busted. They also need to pay out if they don't get a higher hand than a player.

There are a lot of other rules (of course!) that  [you can read](https://bicyclecards.com/how-to-play/blackjack/) up on if you're interested, but the above is everything you need to know to build this game.

Okay, let's get started with some coding!
